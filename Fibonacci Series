Write a Python Program for Fibonacci numbers.
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, . . ., nth term
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

Solution - 

#ENTER THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS WANT TO PRINT IN SERIES
elements = int(input("Enter number of elements: "))

#ELEMENT 1 & ELEMENT 2
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

#CHECKING IF THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IS VALID OR NOT
if elements <= 0:
   print("Please, Enter Positive number: Starting - 1")
elif elements == 1:
   print("Printing upto: ",elements,":")
   print(n1)
else:
   print("Required Fibonacci Series: :")
   while count < elements:
       print(n1)
       terms = n1 + n2
#UPDATION 
       n1 = n2
       n2 = terms
       count += 1

Output - 

Enter number of elements: 10
Required Fibonacci Series: :
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
