Problem - 

Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.

Solution - 

file_name = input("Input Filename: ")
file_extension = file_name.split(".")
print ("Inserted file from User:",file_name,"and File Extension: "+ repr(file_extension[-1]))

Output - 

Input Filename: helloworld.py
