Problem -

Write a Python program to print all positive numbers in a range.
Your Input and output must look something like this
Input: list1 = [12, -7, 5, 64, -14] Output: 12, 5, 64
Input: list2 = [12, 14, -95, 3] Output: [12, 14, 3]

Solution - 

#CREATING AN EMPTY LIST,
lst = []

#NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A LIST,
n = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))

#ITERATING TO THE RANGE and INPUT THE ITEMS,
for i in range(0, n):
    ele = int(input())
    #ADDING ITEMS OT THE LIST
    lst.append(ele) 
    
#CHECKING and PRINTING THE POSITIVE NUMBER,
for i in range(0, n):
    if lst[i] > 0:
        print(lst[i])


Output - 

Enter the number of elements: 5
12
-7
5
64
-14
12
5
64
